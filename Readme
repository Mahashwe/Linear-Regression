Linear_Regression -> **Employee Performance Salary Prediction**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes employee performance and predicts salaries based on **years of experience** using **Linear Regression**. The dataset is preprocessed, trained, and evaluated using **machine learning techniques** with **Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib).**  

## **Dataset**  
- The dataset consists of **1000 employee records** with various attributes like **Age, Gender, Department, Salary, Experience, Performance Score, etc.**  
- **Target Variable:** `Salary`  
- **Feature Used for Prediction:** `Experience`  
- **Missing Values:** The `Salary` column is filled with its mean value.  

## **Dependencies**  
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## **Installation**  
1. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Place the dataset (`Employe_Performance_dataset.csv`) in the working directory.  
3. Run the script to train and evaluate the model.  

## **Steps in the Project**  
1. **Load Data** – Read the dataset using `pandas`.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Check missing values, data types, and visualize relationships.  
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values in `Salary`.  
4. **Feature Selection** – Use `Experience` as the predictor.  
5. **Train-Test Split** – Split data into 80% training and 20% testing.  
6. **Model Training** – Train a **Linear Regression model** using scikit-learn.  
7. **Predictions & Evaluation**  
   - Calculate **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)**.  
   - Plot **actual vs predicted salaries** for better visualization.  

## **Results**  
- The **model predicts salaries** based on years of experience.  
- Evaluated using **MSE and R² score** to measure performance.  

## **Usage**  
Run the script and observe the predicted salaries compared to actual values:  
```python
python salary_prediction.py
```  
This will output **MSE, R² scores**, and a **plot comparing actual vs predicted salaries**.  

## **Limitations**  
- Only considers **Experience** as the predictor, ignoring other factors.  
- The model assumes a **linear relationship**, which may not always be accurate.  
- **Performance Score** has many missing values, which could affect deeper analysis.  

## **Future Improvements**  
- Use **multiple features** (e.g., `Performance Score, Age, Department`) for better predictions.  
- Handle missing data in `Performance Score` effectively.  
- Explore other regression models for better accuracy.
